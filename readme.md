## The Trail

### Description
The Trail aims to provide an easy and efficient hike generating service for individuals traveling to Colorado, or individuals simply seeking a straightforward resource for finding their next adventure.

By completing a short questionnaire, users receive a personalized recommendation. Users will be able to also browse all reviewed hikes, check in at the hike location and comment about the trail status while in proximity, and maneuver advanced Google Map functionality to scope and plan their adventure.

In addition, The Trail features a geo-location live streaming service that allows users to comment about the hike conditions while on the trail. Users become activated via text message and can post to the site only when in the hike location boundaries.
